Time Entry System User Stories
Core Timesheet Management
As a user, I want to create a new timesheet, so that I can organize my time entries for different periods or projects.

As a user, I want to view a list of all my existing timesheets, so that I can easily select and navigate between them.

As a user, I want to give each timesheet a descriptive name, so that I can quickly identify its purpose (e.g., "Week 10 - Client X," "Monthly Report - May").

As a user, I want to delete an existing timesheet, so that I can remove outdated or incorrect records.

Time Entry Management
As a user, I want to add multiple time entries to a selected timesheet, so that I can meticulously record all my work for that specific period.

As a user, I want to input the following details for each time entry:

Project Name: So I know which project the time was spent on.

Start Time: So I can accurately mark when I began working.

End Time: So I can accurately mark when I finished working.

Date: So I know on which day the work occurred.

Notes: So I can add any relevant details or descriptions about the task.

As a user, I want the system to automatically calculate the "Hours" field based on the provided "Start Time" and "End Time" for each entry, so that I don't have to perform manual calculations.

As a user, I want to edit an existing time entry's details, so that I can correct any mistakes or update information.

As a user, I want to delete an existing time entry from a timesheet, so that I can remove erroneous or unnecessary records.

As a user, I want to see a clear, organized display of all time entries within the currently selected timesheet, including all their details (project, start time, end time, hours, date, notes), so that I can easily review my logged work.

Data Export
As a user, I want to export the data of a selected timesheet as a JSON file, so that I can use it for programmatic processing, backup, or integration with other systems.

As a user, I want to export the data of a selected timesheet as a CSV file, so that I can easily open and analyze it in spreadsheet software like Excel or Google Sheets.

System & User Experience
As a user, I want the application to store my timesheet data locally within my browser (using IndexedDB), so that my data persists even if I close the browser and I can access it offline.

As a user, I want the application to have a clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface (using Bootstrap), so that it is easy to use and looks good on various devices and screen sizes.
